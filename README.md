# AI Anti-Patterns

**A shared guide to help developers avoid common coding anti-patterns when working with AI pair programming tools.**

AI-assisted development is here to stay. Tools like Claude, Cursor, and ChatGPT are powerful, but they often reproduce the same mistakes developers have been making for decades â€” because thatâ€™s what theyâ€™ve been trained on.

This project helps you break that cycle.

`ai-anti-patterns` provides a structured, extensible foundation for guiding AI tools toward writing clean, maintainable, and idiomatic code â€” by avoiding the most common anti-patterns seen in real-world projects.

---

## Purpose

This repository aims to:

- Document common anti-patterns AI models tend to reproduce
- Provide actionable guidance to avoid them
- Offer tool-specific configuration templates and examples
- Help individuals and teams establish consistent standards when working with AI

---

## Supported Tools

Each AI model has its own folder, including setup files and guidance:

| Tool      | File/Folders | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Claude    | `GENERAL.md` | Shared behavior and anti-pattern guidance for Claude Code              |
| Cursor    | `CURSOR.md`  | Explanation of `.cursor/rules.toml` configuration                      |
| ChatGPT   | `GENERAL.md` | Use `GENERAL.md` as the prompt basis for ChatGPT (see notes below)      |

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** The `GENERAL.md` file is designed to be tool-agnostic and can be used as the base prompt for ChatGPT sessions or any other AI assistant that benefits from structured behavioral guidance.

## Getting Started

To use this project:

1. Copy the relevant configuration files into your project
2. Customize them based on your teamâ€™s architecture and style
3. Share with your team or embed in your development environment
4. Adapt the anti-pattern guidance to your language or tooling stack
5. Submit a pull request to help others benefit from what youâ€™ve improved

## Acknowledgments

This project was started to help the developer community write better code *with* AI â€” not despite it. Thanks to everyone working to make AI pair programming simpler, more effective, and more human-aware.
