# Contributing to AI Anti-Patterns

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **AI Anti-Patterns**!

This project exists to help developers get better results from AI-assisted development tools by documenting common coding anti-patterns and providing tool-specific guidance. Your contributions make this resource more useful and effective for the entire community.

## Ways to Contribute

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

### üß† Anti-Patterns

- Add new AI-related coding anti-patterns
- Clarify or refine existing ones
- Provide examples (bad vs. good) to illustrate the impact
- Link anti-patterns to specific tools or contexts

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tool-Specific Configurations

- Improve existing Claude, Cursor, or ChatGPT configuration files
- Add support for new tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cody, StarCoder)
- Offer language-specific variants (e.g., idiomatic rules for Go or Rust)

### üí¨ Prompt Templates

- Provide effective prompts for getting better output from AI models
- Offer structured formats for context, constraints, and examples
- Add use-case-specific prompts (e.g., error handling, refactoring)

### üíª Code Examples

- Add before/after code samples showing how AI can be guided
- Demonstrate how AI behavior changes with proper configuration or prompting
